# MetalOS
A OS that is not linux, not bsd and not windows. Ground up OS with just enough to run a QT6 hello world full screen app on AMD64 with Radeon RX 6600 GPU., UEFI native

- Might use Linux kernel only as inspiration for driver code
- Some changes might be required to QT6 - We can git clone this.
