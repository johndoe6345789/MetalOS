# MetalOS
A OS that is not linux, not bsd and not windows. Ground up OS with just enough bespoke kernel to run a QT6 hello world full screen app on AMD64 with Radeon RX 6600 GPU., UEFI native

- Might use Linux kernel only as inspiration for driver code, can be git cloned.
- Some changes might be required to QT6 - We can git clone this.
- Mostly ignoring other peoples OS work.
- One OS launches this One Full Screen QT6 app. No command line, no cruft.
